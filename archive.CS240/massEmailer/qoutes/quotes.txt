Hakuna Matata
There's no crying in baseball
You shall not pass
I'll be back
There's no place like home
I smell cookies
Why so serious
Say hello to my little friend
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you.
Back off, man. I'm a scientist!
What is your major malfunction, numbnuts?
Bond. James Bond.
They call me Mr. Tibbs
Do ya feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk
Get this big walking carpet out of my way
I love the smell of napalm in the morning. It smells like victory
I’d rather kiss a wookie
E.T. phone home
Go ahead. Make my day
Wax on, wax off
Your ego is writing checks your body can’t cash
Tell me something, my friend. You ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight
You can’t handle the truth
Houston, we have a problem
There’s only two men I trust. One of ‘em’s me, the other one’s not you
I’m ‘Blackinese
My mama always said life was like a box a chocolates, never know what you’re gonna get
Stupid is as stupid does
I am the gatekeeper to my own destiny and I will have my glory day in the hot sun.
Chancho, when you are a man, sometimes you wear stretchy pants in your room. It's for fun.
Do you remember the time when everyone was shouting my name, and I used my strength to rip my blouse?
Underneath the robe you find a man. Underneath the man you find his nucleus.
Get that corn outta my face!
I looked like a fool last night. What took you so long!?
It sucks to be me right now.
I get to sleep alone in my bed every night for the rest of my life. It's fantastic.
Don't you want a little taste of the glory! See what it tastes like!
You are crasssssy!
(singing) When the fantasy has ended, and all the children are gone. Something good inside of me, helps me to carry on. I ate somes bugs, I ate some grass. I used my hand, to wipe my tears. To kiss your mouth, I'd break my vow. No, no, no, no, no, no, way Jose. Unless you want to then, we break our vows together! Encarnaciòn! Encarnaciòn! Encarnaciòn!(diddle-diddle-dee, diddle-diddle-dee) Encarnaciòn!
I know it is fun to wrestle. A nice pile-drive to the face; or a punch to the face; but you cannot do it because it is in the Bible not to wrestle your neighbor.
Tonight, I will fight the seven strongest men in town, maybe the world. And I will win because our heavenly father will be in the ring with me. And he and I will win 10,000 pesos.
[While taking a dump] Those guys were a couple a woosies eh.
Well to tell you the truth.
My life is good. Really good.
[To a boy who doesn't want to eat his food] Be grateful, Juan Pablo. Today is especially delicious.
[To a security guard, when he grabs Nacho's new shirt, at a party] Eh. Let go my blouse.
I like your cow
Pssssst Chancho... I need to borrow some sweatssss. Chancho: are you leaving us? Nacho: No, Chancho, I would never leave you. I just need some sweatssss.)
So anyways, let's get down to the nitty gritty
They don't think I know a butt load of crap about the gospel. But I dooo. Okay?
[To some spectators at his first wrestling match] Save me a piece of that corn for later.
Nachoooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!
I need professional help. I need Ramses!. He's the baist. I must learn his hwaaaays.
Anaconda Squeeze!
This man lived a good life. He had a wonderful woman, a lush garden,...and a collection of Russian nesting dolls. May he rest in peace.
Okay. Maybe I am not meant for these duties. Cooking duty. Dead guy... duty. Maybe it's time for me to get a better duty!
I don't want to get paid to lose. I wanna win!
They give me no eagle powers! They give me no nutrients
Hey! Take it eeeaasy!
I don't Believe in God, I believe in science
Nacho, I know someone who can help you
Summon your eagle powers!
Me and my friend are thinking about going pro.
How did you get up here so fast?
I don't know why you always have to be judging me, just because I only believe in science.
I hate all the orphans in the whole world!
Not anymore...I like them!
You gave them permission to hurt me like this.
We saw you from the village... People in the village: Hola Nacho!
Dear Lord, please bless Nacho with nutrients and strength. Amen.
Nunchaku skills... bowhunting skills... computer hacking skills... Girls only want boyfriends who have great skills!
That one looks like a medieval warrior.
I caught you a delicious bass.
Do the chickens have large talons?
Pedro offers you his protection.
Yeah, hold on... I forgot to put in the crystals.
Yeah, there's like a butt-load of gangs at this school. This one gang kept wanting me to join 'cause I'm pretty good with a bo staff.
I see you're drinking 1%. Is that 'cause you think you're fat? Because you're not. You could be drinking whole if you wanted to. Well, I have all your equipment in my locker. You should probably come get it cause I can't fit my nunchakus in there anymore.
YES! YES! YES!
Really? It took me, like, 3 hours to finish the shading on your upper lip. It's probably the best drawing I've ever done.
Are you guys having a killer time?
I like your sleeves... they're real big.
Just listen to your heart. That's what I do.
What the heck are you even talking about?
You got like three feet of air that time. Can I try it really quick?
Tina, you fat lard! Come get some dinner! Tina, eat. Eat the food. EAT THE FOOD!
Tina, come get some ham!
Six dollars? That's like a dollar an hour!
Sorry I'm late. I just got done taming a wild honeymoon stallion for you guys.
I hope you guys' experiences are unforgettable.
LUCKY!
Stay home and eat all the freakin' chips, Kip!
FRIKKIN IDIOT!
Whatever I feel like, GOSH
I love the way your sandy hair floats in the air... To me it's like a lullaby... I'm just flying by... Oh so high... like a kite... tied to a stake.
I'm just getting kinda TO'd. I mean, she hasn't even sent me a full body shot yet.
How 'bout some gold bracelets?
I've been out making some sweet moolah with Uncle Rico.
Lafawnduh is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I'm 100% positive she's my soul mate. Don't worry Napoleon, I'm sure there's a babe out there for you too. Peace out.
[Kip is singing to Lafawnduh after they are pronounced husband and wife] Why do you love me? Why do you need me? Always and forever... We met in a chat room, now our love can fully bloom... Sure the world wide web is great, but you, you make me "salvivate"... Yes, I love technology, but not as much as you, you see... But I still love technology... Always and forever. Our love is like a flock of doves, flying up to Heaven above... always and forever, always and forever... Why do you love me? Why do you need me? Always and forever...
Napoleon, let go of me! I think you're bruising my neck meat!
Geez, I think you ripped my mole off.
Napoleon, don't be jealous that I've been chatting online with babes, all day.
Your mom goes to college
I'm Rex, founder of the Rex Kwon Do self-defense system! After one week with me in my dojo, you'll be prepared to defend yourself with the strength of a grizzly, the reflexes of a puma, and the wisdom of a man. So come down today for your free-trial lesson!
Bow to your sensei. BOW TO YOUR SENSEI!
Grab my arm. The other arm. MY other arm!
At Rex Kwon Do, we use the buddy system. No more flying solo! You need somebody watching your back AT ALL TIMES!
You think I got where I am today because I dressed like Peter Pan over here? [gestures toward Napoleon]
Take a look at what I'm wearing, people. [Points to his American flag pants] You think anybody wants a roundhouse kick to the face while I'm wearing these bad boys? Forget about it.
You think anybody thinks I'm a failure because I go home to Starla at night? [Points at a photo of his wife, a blonde, tan, muscular body-builder] Forget about it!
Just break the wrist, and walk away. Break the wrist; walk away.
C'MERE, BOY!!
How much you wanna make a bet I can throw a football over them mountains?... Yeah... Coach woulda put me in fourth quarter, we would've been state champions. No doubt. No doubt in my mind.
Napoleon, you know we can't afford the fun pack! What, do you think money grows on trees in this family? Take it back! And get some Pampers for you and your brother while you're at it.
Back in '82, I used to be able to toss a pigskin a quarter of a mile.
Your grandma took a spill at the sand dunes today. Broke her coccyx.
Hey, you guys wanna see my video?
Kip, I reckon you know a lot about...cyberspace?
Billowy's good.
I just want you to feel you’re doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
Have fun stormin’ da castle.
I do not envy you the headache you will have when you awake. But for now, rest well and dream of large women.
You've been mostly-dead all day.
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
You only think I guessed wrong! That's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned! Ha ha! You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders - The most famous of which is 'never get involved in a land war in Asia' - but only slightly less well-known is this: 'Never go against a Sicilian when death is on the line!' Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Probably some local fisherman, out for a pleasure cruise, at night... in... eel-infested waters.
I'm just one stomach flu away from my goal weight
I know who I am! I'm a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude!
Badges? We don't need no stinkin' badges!
I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough wiper. I fart in your general direction."
- "Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries."
- "Is there someone else up there we could talk to?" 
- "No, now go away, or I shall taunt you a second time.
They're not gonna catch us. We're on a mission from God.
Thank you for a memorable afternoon. Usually one must go to a bowling alley to meet a woman of your stature.
We've been going about this all wrong. This Mr. Stay-Puffs okay! He's a sailor, he's in New York. We get this guy laid, we won't have any trouble!
Excuse me, sir. Seeing as how the V.P. is such a V.I.P., shouldn't we keep the P.C. on the Q.T.? 'Cause if it leaks to the V.C., he could end up an M.I.A., and then we'd all be put on K.P.
I'm a mog - half man, half dog. I'm my own best friend.
I crap bigger than you.
Roses are red, violets are blue, I'm a schizophrenic and so am I.
Ned, I would love to stand here and talk with you - but I'm not going to.
If I'm not back in five minutes, just wait longer.
It's where I keep all my things. Get a lot of compliments on this. Plus, it's not a man-purse. It's called a satchel. Indiana Jones wears one.
Well, Dick, here's the deal. I'm the best there is. Plain and simple. I mean, I wake up in the morning and I piss excellence. (And nobody can handle my stuff. Uh, you know, I'm just a, just a big hairy American winnin' machine. If you ain't first, you're last. You know, you know what I'm talkin' about? That phrase is trademarked not to be used without permission of Ricky Bobby, Inc.)
It's amazing how he fell perfectly into the drawing on the floor.
And I-I said, I don't care if they lay me off, either. Because I told, I told Bill that if they move my desk one more time, then, then I'm, I'm quitting. I'm going to quit. And, and I told Don too, because they've moved my desk four times already this year, and I used to be over by the window, and I could see the squirrels and they were married, but then they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline stapler because it didn't bind up as much and I kept the staples for the Swingline stapler....And, oh, no, it's not okay because if they make me, if they, If they take my stapler then I'll, I'll have to, I'll set the building on fire.
Yeah I called her up, she gave me a bunch of crap about me not listenin' to her enough, or somethin'. I don't know, I wasn't really payin' attention.
Just when I think you couldn't possibly be any dumber, you go and do somethin' like this -- and totally redeem yourself! Ha Ha!

Dear Lord, please bless Nacho with nutrients and strength. Amen.
Nunchaku skills... bowhunting skills... computer hacking skills... Girls only want boyfriends who have great skills!
That one looks like a medieval warrior.
I caught you a delicious bass.
Do the chickens have large talons?
Pedro offers you his protection.
Yeah, hold on... I forgot to put in the crystals.
Yeah, there's like a butt-load of gangs at this school. This one gang kept wanting me to join 'cause I'm pretty good with a bo staff.
I see you're drinking 1%. Is that 'cause you think you're fat? Because you're not. You could be drinking whole if you wanted to. Well, I have all your equipment in my locker. You should probably come get it cause I can't fit my nunchakus in there anymore.
YES! YES! YES!
Really? It took me, like, 3 hours to finish the shading on your upper lip. It's probably the best drawing I've ever done.
Are you guys having a killer time?
I like your sleeves... they're real big.
Just listen to your heart. That's what I do.
What the heck are you even talking about?
You got like three feet of air that time. Can I try it really quick?
Tina, you fat lard! Come get some dinner! Tina, eat. Eat the food. EAT THE FOOD!
Tina, come get some ham!
Six dollars? That's like a dollar an hour!
Sorry I'm late. I just got done taming a wild honeymoon stallion for you guys.
I hope you guys' experiences are unforgettable.
LUCKY!
Stay home and eat all the freakin' chips, Kip!
FRIKKIN IDIOT!
Whatever I feel like, GOSH
I love the way your sandy hair floats in the air... To me it's like a lullaby... I'm just flying by... Oh so high... like a kite... tied to a stake.
I'm just getting kinda TO'd. I mean, she hasn't even sent me a full body shot yet.
How 'bout some gold bracelets?
I've been out making some sweet moolah with Uncle Rico.
Lafawnduh is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I'm 100% positive she's my soul mate. Don't worry Napoleon, I'm sure there's a babe out there for you too. Peace out.
[Kip is singing to Lafawnduh after they are pronounced husband and wife] Why do you love me? Why do you need me? Always and forever... We met in a chat room, now our love can fully bloom... Sure the world wide web is great, but you, you make me "salvivate"... Yes, I love technology, but not as much as you, you see... But I still love technology... Always and forever. Our love is like a flock of doves, flying up to Heaven above... always and forever, always and forever... Why do you love me? Why do you need me? Always and forever...
Napoleon, let go of me! I think you're bruising my neck meat!
Geez, I think you ripped my mole off.
Napoleon, don't be jealous that I've been chatting online with babes, all day.
Your mom goes to college
I'm Rex, founder of the Rex Kwon Do self-defense system! After one week with me in my dojo, you'll be prepared to defend yourself with the strength of a grizzly, the reflexes of a puma, and the wisdom of a man. So come down today for your free-trial lesson!
Bow to your sensei. BOW TO YOUR SENSEI!
Grab my arm. The other arm. MY other arm!
At Rex Kwon Do, we use the buddy system. No more flying solo! You need somebody watching your back AT ALL TIMES!
You think I got where I am today because I dressed like Peter Pan over here? [gestures toward Napoleon]
Take a look at what I'm wearing, people. [Points to his American flag pants] You think anybody wants a roundhouse kick to the face while I'm wearing these bad boys? Forget about it.
You think anybody thinks I'm a failure because I go home to Starla at night? [Points at a photo of his wife, a blonde, tan, muscular body-builder] Forget about it!
Just break the wrist, and walk away. Break the wrist; walk away.
C'MERE, BOY!!
How much you wanna make a bet I can throw a football over them mountains?... Yeah... Coach woulda put me in fourth quarter, we would've been state champions. No doubt. No doubt in my mind.
Napoleon, you know we can't afford the fun pack! What, do you think money grows on trees in this family? Take it back! And get some Pampers for you and your brother while you're at it.
Back in '82, I used to be able to toss a pigskin a quarter of a mile.
Your grandma took a spill at the sand dunes today. Broke her coccyx.
Hey, you guys wanna see my video?
Kip, I reckon you know a lot about...cyberspace?
Billowy's good.
I just want you to feel you’re doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
Have fun stormin’ da castle.
I do not envy you the headache you will have when you awake. But for now, rest well and dream of large women.
You've been mostly-dead all day.
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
You only think I guessed wrong! That's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned! Ha ha! You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders - The most famous of which is 'never get involved in a land war in Asia' - but only slightly less well-known is this: 'Never go against a Sicilian when death is on the line!' Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Probably some local fisherman, out for a pleasure cruise, at night... in... eel-infested waters.
I'm just one stomach flu away from my goal weight
I know who I am! I'm a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude!
Badges? We don't need no stinkin' badges!
I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough wiper. I fart in your general direction."
- "Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries."
- "Is there someone else up there we could talk to?" 
- "No, now go away, or I shall taunt you a second time.
They're not gonna catch us. We're on a mission from God.
Thank you for a memorable afternoon. Usually one must go to a bowling alley to meet a woman of your stature.
We've been going about this all wrong. This Mr. Stay-Puffs okay! He's a sailor, he's in New York. We get this guy laid, we won't have any trouble!
Excuse me, sir. Seeing as how the V.P. is such a V.I.P., shouldn't we keep the P.C. on the Q.T.? 'Cause if it leaks to the V.C., he could end up an M.I.A., and then we'd all be put on K.P.
I'm a mog - half man, half dog. I'm my own best friend.
I crap bigger than you.
Roses are red, violets are blue, I'm a schizophrenic and so am I.
Ned, I would love to stand here and talk with you - but I'm not going to.
If I'm not back in five minutes, just wait longer.
It's where I keep all my things. Get a lot of compliments on this. Plus, it's not a man-purse. It's called a satchel. Indiana Jones wears one.
Well, Dick, here's the deal. I'm the best there is. Plain and simple. I mean, I wake up in the morning and I piss excellence. (And nobody can handle my stuff. Uh, you know, I'm just a, just a big hairy American winnin' machine. If you ain't first, you're last. You know, you know what I'm talkin' about?

It's amazing how he fell perfectly into the drawing on the floor.
And I-I said, I don't care if they lay me off, either. Because I told, I told Bill that if they move my desk one more time, then, then I'm, I'm quitting. I'm going to quit. And, and I told Don too, because they've moved my desk four times already this year, and I used to be over by the window, and I could see the squirrels and they were married, but then they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline stapler because it didn't bind up as much and I kept the staples for the Swingline stapler....And, oh, no, it's not okay because if they make me, if they, If they take my stapler then I'll, I'll have to, I'll set the building on fire.
Yeah I called her up, she gave me a bunch of crap about me not listenin' to her enough, or somethin'. I don't know, I wasn't really payin' attention.
Just when I think you couldn't possibly be any dumber, you go and do somethin' like this -- and totally redeem yourself! Ha Ha!
