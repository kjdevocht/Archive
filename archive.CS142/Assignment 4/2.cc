/*Kevin DeVocht Assignment 4: Exercise 2 What are the truth values of x > 3, 4 > x && x > 3, and x * x == x when x is 4?*/

/*The truth value of x > 3 when x = 4 is true
The truth value of 4 > x && x > 3 when x = 4 is false because 4 is not greater than 4
The truth value of x*x = x when x = 4 is false because 4 * 4 = 16 and not 4*/
