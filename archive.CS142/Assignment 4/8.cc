/*Kevin DeVocht Assignment 4: Exercise 8. Some credit card companies pay back a small portion of the charges a customer makes over a year. One company returns .25% for the first $500 of charges, .50% for the next $1000 
(that is, the portion between $500 and $1500), .75% for the next $1000 (that is, the portion between $1500 and $2500), and 1.0% for everything above $2500.

Thus, a customer who charges $400 a year receives $1.00, which is 0.25  1/100  400, and one who charges $1,400 a year receives $5.75, which is 1.25 = 0.25  1/100  500 for the first $500 and 0.50  1/100  900 = 4.50 
for the next $900.

Determine by hand the pay-backs for a customer who charged $2000 and one who charged $2600.

Define the function payback, which consumes a charge amount and computes the corresponding pay-back amount.
*/

/* if a customer charged $2000 dollars you would first see at which percentage rate they would be recieving paybacks
	2000 > 500
	2000 > 1500
	2000 < 2500
so we can see that this would fall into the 0.75% category so we will just
2000 * (0.75 1/100) = $15

next to see how much a customer who charger $2600 will get you follow the same process
	2600 > 500
	2600 > 1500
	2600 > 2500
this means that this custmer will be paid back at the 1% rate so to find out just
	2600 *(1 * 1/100) = $26
