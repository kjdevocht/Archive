Through-out this course we have been nicely asked, gently nudged and at times 
forcibly pushed to use the design process.  I will admit that I have stubbornly 
resisted and avoided using it as much as possible.  There really is no reason why 
I have spent so much energy avoiding using this helpful tool.  I would find myself 
trying to complete an assignment and thinking that I did not have time to implement 
the design process as showed in class.  I would then go on to spend hours trying to 
do it my way and in the end “break down” and use the design process.   Towards the 
end of the semester I began to see the use and benefits of using the design process.
I think one of the things that helped was having problems that I was unable to 
figure out in my head.  Also I began to use the design process to help me rather 
than just put it in my program because it was required.  The funny thing was, 
once I began actually using it to benefit me, it became very helpful.  This whole 
semester I have thought of it as the programing design process but once I sat done
to write this assignment I realized a better title would be the problem solving 
design process.  With a few simple changes and most of those to terminology, you 
can apply this process to any problem you might have.  Can you imagine trying to 
make a cake with no real thought put into it?  What about building a house?  You 
must know the end results for each of tasks before you can even begin to think 
about baking or building.  Let’s take the example of building a house and use the 
design process to achieve the end result that we want.  First we must decide what 
we really want in the end.  There is a huge difference between building a skyscraper 
and just building a tool shed.  So once we have decided on the result we begin to 
break the whole project into pieces.  In a very simplistic version you have rough 
framers, plumbers, electricians, heating and air, painter, finish carpenter and the 
landscapers.  Each of these is like a function.  They have their own piece of the 
process to complete.  We know what each part requires to complete their task and what 
the end result should be.  Test also known as inspections in the construction industry 
are conducted every step of the way to insure that there are no problems up to that 
point.  It would make no sense to build the whole house just to find out that there 
were foundation issues.  These inspections compare the results of each portion of 
construction to predetermined test cases aka regulations. The regulations drive the 
methods of construction and the results of each portion of construction.  This is 
similar to the tests inside of each function.  Every construction project is different 
and so the workers must know what the expected outcome is to properly complete their 
phase of construction.   During each phase of construction the workers reference the 
blueprints which serve the same purpose as the contract statement, purpose and 
template of a function.  The blueprint tells the worker what needs to be done and what 
materials can be used in each case.  Each group of workers have rules and regulations 
that they must comply to in order to make the whole product function correctly.  While 
each group of workers must rely on each other, they don’t really know what the other 
groups do or how to do it themselves.  This quick look at the construction process 
shows that the design process really is universal.  The core concepts are the same for 
just about every problem.  You need to know what you want to achieve before you begin.  
You need to have specific bench marks or test cases to compare your results to.  You 
need to break the whole problem down into manageable portions that are both easy to 
solve and easy to complete.  Each of these sections need to be independent of each 
other but still able to fit together to solve the overall problem.  If this process is 
properly implemented when dealing with any problem I truly believe that the end 
results will be better, the time needed to accomplish your goals will be less, and the 
process itself will be more efficient.  I believe that the use of this process is the 
true mark of professionalism in any area.
