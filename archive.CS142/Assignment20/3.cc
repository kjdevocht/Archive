/* Kevin DeVocht Assingment 21 exercise 3. Make five concrete, actionable suggestions 
about how this class could have helped you learn programming better. Make sure you 
explain why your suggestion would make things better—i.e. why there was something wrong 
to begin with. For example, you could suggest improvements to exercises, lectures, class 
policy, etc. You will not get any credit if you give "wishes" or "problems"; you will 
only give get credit if you combine wishes with their "fulfillment" or problems with 
their "solutions".*/

1.	The first problem that I see is with the written instructions for the exercises.  
	I know that part of the problem is that I don’t read them carefully enough but I 
	also feel that part of the problem comes from the instructions themselves.  I often
	found myself not really sure what exactly I was supposed to do.  You sometimes used 
	different terms for the same things and when you are just learning a new concept 
	this can be confusing.  Some of the exercises had very good instructions. But 
	several times I had to ask for clarification.  Exercise 2.1 was one that I remember 
	being confused on.  It does not make clear if the whole tip is to be included or if 
	just your share of the tip is to  be included in your cost.  Once you clarified it 
	for me it became clear but the instructions did not clearly state it to me.  I feel 
	that if you reword the instructions and make them explicitly clear this will help the 
	students feel more confident when they sit down to work on the programs plus it will 
	reduce your work load.  Most of the posts to the group where clarifying questions on 
	the instructions or at least a lot of them were.  Now I know this will not eliminate 
	these types of questions but I think it will help reduce them.  As a student you must 
	always cater to the professor and doing things your way or the way you thing it should 
	be can result in you getting bad grades on assignments.  So if you could be very 
	explicit with what you want and what you mean in your instructions I think this would 
	help very one.
2.	The second aspect of the course I think would improve the overall learning experience 
	of the student would be a decreased work load.  Now, if this class is designed to weed out 
	students form the CS program then this suggestion should be ignored but if that is not the 
	case then I think there is a valid claim.  This class was by far more time intensive than 
	any other college course I have every taken.  I think the best way to reduce the time each 
	student must invest in each assignment, is to give the student more information for each 
	assignment.  By this I mean that if the program needs booleanToString that you say it is 
	needed of later on after we have done append and we use it again say it should use append 
	or this is  a folding function and that kind of information.  This way the student can 
	focus on the new problem rather than try and figure everything out for every single 
	exercise.
3.	Something simple that I already talked to you about but never heard back about was 
	having an incomplete dry-turnin.  I know that I missed at least one point because of 
	this.  I compiled my program to make sure it worked and somehow between then and when 
	I turned in the exercise a small change was made.  I think a random character was in 
	my program so it did not compile.  So I guess my suggestion is that you should have an 
	incomplete dry-turnin option
4.	Now I don’t know if you only posted grades on the CS network because blackboard is 
	being phased out or what but this semester in order to check my grades I had to look 
	in three different places, blackboard, university grade book and the cs network for 
	your class.  Also I could only check my grades from a computer that had putty or the 
	equivalent.  I would appreciate it if you would also put our grades in university 
	grade book or where ever BYU is moving towards.
5.	The last problem I saw during this semester was the discrepancies between what the 
	TA’s said and what you said.  I would ask both you and the TA’s a question and get exact 
	opposite answers at times.  This is big problem when you do all the grading and exercises 
	are pass or fail.  I think the solution to this is to have the TA’s do every assignment 
	one ahead of the students and have you grade them.  That way the program is fresh in their 
	minds and they know what you expect when grading the program.  I think this will also have 
	the added benefit of the TA’s know about how long it should take what problems the students 
	might encounter and how to fix them.
